Authentification



1. Basic principle


## 1.1 Authentification vs authorisation

**Authentification:**

Means the user has to verify who he is, this means he has to login, this means he has to prove that he is who he is.This works via Password and username

**Authorisation **

Describes what the user is authorised to do, for example only see or see and edit documents in Teams. It describes what the user is able to do when he authenticated himself.
